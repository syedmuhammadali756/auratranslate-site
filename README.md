# AuraTranslate AI — The First Roman Urdu Aware Translator 🇵🇰✨

**AuraTranslate AI** is a privacy-first browser extension designed specifically for the bilingual needs of South Asia. Unlike generic translators, AuraTranslate understands **Roman Urdu** (Urdu written in English script) and translates it into natural, professional English — and vice versa. Isse "kia scene hai" ka matlab pata hai.
